                Old Courtallam, located a few kilometres from the main Courtallam area in Tenkasi, is a quieter and more serene destination known for its refreshing waterfall and peaceful natural surroundings. Unlike the busy Main Falls, Old Courtallam Falls has a gentler flow and a spacious bathing area, making it popular among families and elderly visitors who prefer a calmer experience. The water here flows through dense forests of the Western Ghats, giving it a cool, herbal quality that Courtallam is famous for. The area is surrounded by greenery, rocky landscapes, small shops, and resting spots, creating a perfect atmosphere for relaxing and enjoying nature. With its cleaner environment, lighter crowds, and soothing ambience, Old Courtallam is often considered the best place for those seeking a refreshing and peaceful retreat in Courtallam.
