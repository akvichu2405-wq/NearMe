                Courtallam, often called the **“Spa of South India,”** is a beautiful tourist destination in Tenkasi district, Tamil Nadu, famous for its numerous waterfalls, lush Western Ghats surroundings, and the medicinal qualities of its waters. Nestled at the foothills of the Agasthiyamalai range, Courtallam’s waterfalls—such as Main Falls, Five Falls, Old Courtallam, Honey Falls, Shenbaga Devi Falls, and Tiger Falls—attract visitors from across the state, especially during the monsoon season. The water here is believed to flow through forests rich in herbs and medicinal plants, giving it unique healing properties. Apart from waterfalls, Courtallam offers scenic viewpoints, eco-parks, trekking paths, temples like Arulmigu Thirukuttralanathar Temple, and peaceful riverside spots, making it a perfect blend of nature, spirituality, and relaxation. Its cool climate, refreshing atmosphere, and vibrant local culture make Courtallam a favourite getaway for families, tourists, and nature lovers.
