                Shenbaga Devi Temple, located near the **Shenbaga Devi Falls** in Courtallam, is a serene and spiritually significant shrine dedicated to **Goddess Shenbaga Devi**, a form of Goddess Amman. The temple sits deep inside the forested region of the Western Ghats, and reaching it involves a scenic uphill trek of about **2–3 km**, passing through streams, rocks, and lush greenery, making the journey itself a refreshing experience for devotees and nature lovers. The temple is small but sacred, surrounded by shenbaga (magnolia) trees, from which it gets its name. Pilgrims believe that the goddess protects travellers and blesses them with health, prosperity, and peace. The path to the temple is especially lively during the Courtallam season, with cool breezes, flowing water, and the sound of birds adding to the ambience. Shenbaga Devi Temple is not just a place of worship but also a peaceful retreat where spirituality and nature blend beautifully.
